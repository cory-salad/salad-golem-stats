# Stats Salad Dashboard

This project provides a dashboard for visualizing network statistics for SaladCloud's testing on the Golem Network. It includes a frontend React application, a Python FastAPI backend, and a PostgreSQL database.

## Current Project Status

This is a summary of the current state of the project based on recent development notes.

*   **Frontend (`/frontend`):** 
    *   **Globe:** The globe visualization is working and displays daily active nodes from a snapshot. This could be updated to show live data or only nodes participating in the test, but the current implementation avoids a sparse-looking map.
    *   **Transaction Table:** The data in this table is currently mocked. 
    *   **Trend Graphs:** 
*   **Backend (`/backend`):** The FastAPI backend is functional for its current purpose, serving data to the frontend from the database.
*   **Data (`/db`, `/data-collection`):** The database contains processed data. The data sources are expected to change.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A shell environment to run the `.sh` script (like Git Bash on Windows, or any standard Linux/macOS shell).
*   Docker and Docker Compose to run the PostgreSQL database.
*   Node.js and npm for the frontend.
*   Python for the backend.

### Running the Application

Before running the application you'll need get data either by importing a dumped database or processing a plans database with data-collection/process_plans.py and data-collection/get_globe_data.py (requires credentials for querying Matrix mongo database).
The easiest way to get everything running is to use the provided script.

1.  **Set up Environment Variables:** Before running, you must create the required `.env` files as detailed in the "Environment Variables" section below.
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    ./start-dev.sh
    ```
    This script will:
    *   Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose.
    *   Start the FastAPI backend with Uvicorn.
    *   Start the React frontend development server.

## Environment Variables

You will need to create the following `.env` files in their respective directories.

### 1. Frontend (`/frontend/.env`)

This file configures the React application.

```
VITE_STATS_API_URL="http://localhost:8000"
```

### 2. Backend (`/backend/.env`)

This file configures the FastAPI server and its database connection.

```
FRONTEND_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,http://127.0.0.1:5173,http://localhost:5174,http://127.0.0.1:5174
POSTGRES_USER=devuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_DB=statsdb
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

### 3. Data Collection (`/data-collection/.env`)

This file configures the scripts used for data gathering and processing.

```
# Postgres connection for writing data
POSTGRES_USER=devuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=devpass
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_DB=statsdb
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# MongoDB and Strapi credentials for get_data.py (out of date)
MONGOUSER=
MONGOPASS=
MONGO_URL="matrix-production-1.qltsap.mongodb.net"
DBNAME="matrix"
MIN_SEL=2003009
STRAPIURL="https://cms-api.salad.io"
STRAPIID=
STRAPIPW=
```

## Project Structure

*   **/backend:** The FastAPI application that serves data via a REST API.
    *   `main.py`: The main application file.
    *   **Endpoints:**
        *   `/metrics/city_counts`: Provides geolocated node counts for the globe visualization.
        *   `/metrics/transactions`: Serves mocked transaction data.
        *   `/metrics/trends`: Provides aggregated data for the trend graphs. 
        *   `/metrics/stats`: Provides aggregated data for stats. 
*   **/db:** Contains the `docker-compose.yaml` to spin up the PostgreSQL database and a `/migrations` directory with the schema.
*   **/data-collection:** Contains Python scripts for pulling data from various sources (e.g., Mixpanel, MongoDB) and processing it into the PostgreSQL database.
*   **/frontend:** A React application built with Vite that consumes the backend API and displays the dashboard.
